# Pusher HTTP PHP library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-http-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pusher/pusher-http-php)

PHP library for interacting with the Pusher HTTP API.

In order to use this library, you need to have an account on
<https://pusher.com>. After registering, you will need the application
credentials for your app.

Libraries can also offer additional helper functionality to ensure interactions with the HTTP API only occur if they will not be rejected e.g. [channel naming conventions][channel-names]. For information on the helper functionality that this library supports please see the **Helper Functionality** section.

## Installation

Use [composer](http://getcomposer.org) to install this bundle.

```
$ composer require pusher/pusher-http
```

You need PHP 5.3+ to use this library.

## Configuration

```php
$pusher = Pusher::fromEnv();
```

Or with App ID, key and secret:

```php
$pusher_config = new Pusher::Config(array(
  appId  => 'APP_ID',
  key    => 'APP_KEY',
  secret => 'SECRET_KEY'
));
```

### Additional options

The library also supports configuration specialization by passing an options
array to the various constructors:

```php
$pusher = Pusher::fromEnv('PUSHER_URL', options => (
    'http_proxy' => "http://foobar",
    'timeout' => "5s",
);
```

## Usage


### Triggering events


Compatibility
-------------

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).


Publishing/Triggering events
----------------------------

To trigger an event on one or more channels use the `trigger` function.

### A single channel

```php
$pusher->trigger( 'my-channel', 'my_event', 'hello world' );
```

### Multiple channels

```php
$pusher->trigger( [ 'channel-1', 'channel-2' ], 'my_event', 'hello world' );
```

### Arrays

Objects are automatically converted to JSON format:

```php
$event_data = array('name' => 'joe', 'message_count' => 23);
$pusher->trigger('my_channel', 'my_event', $event_data);
```

The output of this will be:

```json
{'name': 'joe', 'message_count': 23}
```

### Socket id

In order to avoid duplicates you can optionally specify the sender's socket id while triggering an event ( http://pusher.com/docs/duplicates ):

```php
$pusher->trigger('my-channel','event','data','socket_id');
```

## Authenticating Private channels

To authorise your users to access private channels on Pusher, you can use the socket_auth function:

    $pusher->socket_auth('my-channel','socket_id');

## Authenticating Presence channels

Using presence channels is similar to private channels, but you can specify extra data to identify that particular user:

    $pusher->presence_auth('my-channel','socket_id', 'user_id', 'user_info');

### Presence example

First set this variable in your JS app:

    Pusher.channel_auth_endpoint = '/presence_auth.php';

Next, create the following in presence_auth.php:

    <?php
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    if ($_SESSION['user_id']){
      $sql = "SELECT * FROM `users` WHERE id='$_SESSION[user_id]'";
      $result = mysql_query($sql,$mysql);
      $user = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
    } else {
      die('aaargh, no-one is logged in')
    }

    $pusher = new Pusher($key, $secret, $app_id);
    $presence_data = array('name' => $user['name']);
    echo $pusher->presence_auth($_POST['channel_name'], $_POST['socket_id'], $user['id'], $presence_data);
    ?>

Note: this assumes that you store your users in a table called `users` and that those users have a `name` column. It also assumes that you have a login mechanism that stores the `user_id` of the logged in user in the session.

## Application State Queries

## Generic get function

    pusher->get( $path, $params )

Used to make `GET` queries against the Pusher HTTP API. Handles authentication.

Response is an associative array with a `result` index. The contents of this index is dependent on the HTTP method that was called. However, a `status` property to allow the HTTP status code is always present and a `result` property will be set if the status code indicates a successful call to the API.

    $response = $pusher->get( '/channels' );
    $http_status_code = $response[ 'status' ];
    $result = $response[ 'result' ];

### Get information about a channel

    get_channel_info( $name )

It's also possible to get information about a channel from the Pusher HTTP API.

    $info = $pusher->get_channel_info('channel-name');
    $channel_occupied = $info->occupied;

This can also be achieved using the generic `pusher->get` function:

    pusher->get( '/channels/channel-name' );

### Get a list of application channels

    get_channels()

It's also possible to get a list of channels for an application from the Pusher HTTP API.

    $result = $pusher->get_channels();
    $channel_count = count($result->channels); // $channels is an Array

This can also be achieved using the generic `pusher->get` function:

    pusher->get( '/channels' );

### Get a filtered list of application channels

    get_channels( array( 'filter_by_prefix' => 'some_filter' ) )

It's also possible to get a list of channels based on their name prefix. To do this you need to supply an $options parameter to the call. In the following example the call will return a list of all channels with a 'presence-' prefix. This is idea for fetching a list of all presence channels.

    $results = $pusher->get_channels( array( 'filter_by_prefix' => 'presence-') );
    $channel_count = count($result->channels); // $channels is an Array

This can also be achieved using the generic `pusher->get` function:

    $pusher->get( '/channels', array( 'filter_by_prefix' => 'presence-' ) );

### Get user information from a presence channel

    $response = $pusher->get( '/channels/presence-channel-name/users' )

The `$response` is in the format:

```
Array
(
    [body] => {"users":[{"id":"a_user_id"}]}
    [status] => 200
    [result] => Array
        (
            [users] => Array
                (
                    [0] => Array
                        (
                            [id] => a_user_id
                        )
                    /* Additional users */
                )
        )
)
```
